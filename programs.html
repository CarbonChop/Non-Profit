        <h1>Summer Meals</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Thanks to No Kid Hungry, there is a federal program to help families buy food during the summer. There is another program that helps rural communities offer meal deliveries and pick-up services, instead of requiring children to travel to meal sites.</p>
        <p><b>Grocery Cards -</b> Families who need help will receive $120 per child for the summer. This is known as summer electronic benefits transfer (summer EBT). We are working the USDA to make sure they get all the necessary information to the state agencies that administer benefit programs.</p>
        <p><b>Free Meals in Rural Communities - </b>Many communities offer free meals to children during the summer, typically at schools, community centers or public libraries. But for many years, children were only allowed to eat the food if they stayed there. This meant that kids who lived far from such a meals site might not get the chance to eat - especially in rural communities. We are providing grant funding to schools and community groups so they can get what they need to run their summer meals programs - from delivery vehicles to kitchen equipment. </p>
